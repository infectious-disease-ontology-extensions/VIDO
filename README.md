# VIDO
The Virus Infectious Disease Ontology (VIDO) is an extension of the Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO). VIDO follows OBO Foundry guidelines, employs the Basic Formal Ontology as its starting point, and covers epidemiology, classification, pathogenesis, and treatment of terms used by virologists, i.e. virus, prion, satellite, viroid, etc.
